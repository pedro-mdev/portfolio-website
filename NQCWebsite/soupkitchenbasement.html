        <p class="pc2"><span style="color: yellow;"><b>Soup Kitchen Basement</b></span> really is the edgiest of the Northern Quarter clubs. It hosts some <span style="color: yellow;">crazy</span> events, from heavy metal to pounding techno. It's the place for Manchester's hardcore clubbers.</p>
        <p class="pc2">This is a place that has <span style="color: yellow;">absolutely no dress code</span>; you could walk in wearing your joggers or your finest suit, nobody would bat an eyelid. In this club, anything goes.</p>
        <p class="pc2">If you're a smoker and you're looking for a nice place to smoke your ciggarettes, this isn't the place. The smoking area is just outside in the alley where the entrance is, and for those hygiene enthusiasts, the <span style="color: yellow;">toilets are worse than the average club</span>. With the walls consisting of plywood sheets, it really doesn't offer the best of privacy.</p>
        <p class="pc2">If you've lasted this long, you probably want to know about the prices. This is where SKB shines; with cans of beer for sale at a mere £2 with <span style="color: yellow;">student discount</span>, and single shots of your spirit of choice being sold at £2.50, <span style="color: yellow;">you're sure to get your buzz!</span></p>
        <p class="pc2">For anyone wondering about transport, it's not far from Manchester's central <span style="color: yellow;">bus station</span> which has night busses running to most parts of the city. If you're more of a Taxi person, there's plenty of those around too (especially around 3 - 4am.</p>
